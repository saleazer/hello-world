Github tutorial

Hey there! Looks like you've stumbled upon my hello-world tutorial README.  You must be very bored because there's not much to this. I'm just trying to get my practice in, happy coding..  =)

Looks like I'm going for the easy W and making a change to my own practice stuff.  Yay for the easy route today!
